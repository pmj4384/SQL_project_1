# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project 1

## Overview  
This SQL project analyzes retail sales data to uncover key business insights. It covers sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance in a retail environment.

## Data  
The main table, `retail_sales`, includes transaction details such as date, time, customer info, product category, quantity, and sales amounts.

## Key Analyses  
- Cleaned and validated data by removing incomplete records.  
- Explored total sales and unique customers.  
- Analyzed sales by category, customer demographics, and transaction size.  
- Identified top-performing months and customers.  
- Examined sales patterns by time of day (shift analysis).  

## Techniques  
Utilized SQL features like aggregations (SUM, AVG), window functions (RANK), date/time functions (EXTRACT), and conditional logic (CASE WHEN) to answer business questions effectively.

## How to Use  
Load the `retail_sales` data into PostgreSQL and run the queries using pgAdmin or any SQL client. Adjust queries as needed for further exploration.

## Business Impact  
This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, analysis, and insight generation—key capabilities for data-driven decision making in retail and related industries.
